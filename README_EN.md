[**‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÊú¨**](./README.md)

üè†[Document](https://docs.xray.cool)  ‚¨áÔ∏è[Download](https://github.com/chaitin/xray/releases) 

Note: xray is not open source, you can download the built binaries directly, and the poc in the repository, which is mainly contributed by the community, will be packaged automatically for each xray release.

## üöÄ Quick use

**Before using the tool, read and agree to the terms especially the disclaimer in the [License](https://github.com/chaitin/xray/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Otherwise, do not install or use the tool.**

1. Use the base basic web crawler scan to scrape and perform vulnerability scanning on the scraped links

    ```bash
    xray webscan --basic-crawler http://example.com --html-output vuln.html
    ```

2. Use an HTTP proxy for passive scanning

    ```bash
    xray webscan --listen 127.0.0.1:7777 --html-output proxy.html
    ```
   Set the browser http proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:7777` to analyze proxy traffic and scan automatically.

   >To scan https traffic, read the `Crawling https Traffic` section below

3. Only a single url is scanned, without crawlers

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b --html-output single-url.html
    ```

4. Manually configure the plugins to run this time

   By default, all built-in plugins are enabled. You can specify which plugins are enabled for this scan using the following command.

   ```bash
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --url http://example.com
   xray webscan --plugins cmd-injection,sqldet --listen 127.0.0.1:7777
   ```

5. Specifying plugin output

   You can choose targeted vulnerability and their details of this scan and export a report:

    ```bash
    xray webscan --url http://example.com/?a=b \
    --text-output result.txt --json-output result.json --html-output report.html
    ```
